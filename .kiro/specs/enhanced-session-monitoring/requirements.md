# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing AI Handoff MCP server with comprehensive session lifecycle management, monitoring capabilities, and operational insights. The enhancement focuses on making the system production-ready by adding session expiration, cleanup mechanisms, structured logging, health monitoring, and analytics to understand handoff patterns and system performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated session lifecycle management, so that the system can handle long-running operations without manual intervention and prevent resource exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL set a configurable expiration time (default 24 hours)
2. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically archive the session data to cold storage
3. WHEN a session is inactive for a configurable period THEN the system SHALL mark it as dormant and reduce its cache priority
4. IF a session has been archived THEN the system SHALL still allow read-only access to historical data
5. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL automatically clean up any orphaned or corrupted session data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can track system health, debug issues, and ensure reliable operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any MCP tool is called THEN the system SHALL log the request with structured data including session ID, tool name, execution time, and outcome
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context and stack traces
3. WHEN system resources reach threshold levels THEN the system SHALL emit warning logs and metrics
4. IF database or Redis connections fail THEN the system SHALL log connection status and attempt automatic reconnection
5. WHEN a handoff is completed THEN the system SHALL log handoff metrics including duration, context size, and success status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want health monitoring endpoints, so that I can integrate the system with monitoring tools and ensure service availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return database connectivity status, Redis connectivity status, and overall system health
2. WHEN the metrics endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return Prometheus-compatible metrics for sessions, handoffs, and system performance
3. IF any critical dependency is unavailable THEN the health endpoint SHALL return an unhealthy status with details
4. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the metrics SHALL reflect increased response times and error rates
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN the health endpoint SHALL still respond within 1 second

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want session and handoff analytics, so that I can understand usage patterns, identify bottlenecks, and improve the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessions are created and completed THEN the system SHALL track session duration, context volume, and participant count
2. WHEN handoffs occur THEN the system SHALL record handoff success rates, average processing time, and failure reasons
3. WHEN context is updated THEN the system SHALL track context growth patterns and content type distribution
4. IF handoff patterns show anomalies THEN the system SHALL provide insights into potential issues or optimization opportunities
5. WHEN analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated data without exposing sensitive session content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring and optimization, so that the system can handle increased load and maintain responsive performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL track query performance and identify slow queries
2. WHEN Redis cache operations occur THEN the system SHALL monitor cache hit rates and performance
3. IF memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger garbage collection and log memory statistics
4. WHEN concurrent sessions increase THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 500ms for standard operations
5. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent overload

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable retention policies, so that I can manage storage costs while maintaining necessary historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN administrators SHALL be able to set retention periods for active sessions, archived sessions, and logs
2. WHEN retention periods expire THEN the system SHALL automatically delete old data according to the configured policy
3. IF legal or compliance requirements exist THEN the system SHALL support extended retention for specific session types
4. WHEN data is deleted THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity and log the deletion actions
5. WHEN storage usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest retention policy adjustments
