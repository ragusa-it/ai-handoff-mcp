# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a robust, production-ready MCP Server that enables seamless context handoff between different AI tools and agents. The system should provide reliable session management, efficient context transfer, and comprehensive tool integration while maintaining simplicity and performance for the core handoff workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to register a handoff session, so that I can prepare to transfer context to another AI tool with a unique session identifier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the register_session tool THEN the system SHALL create a new session with a unique session key and return session details
2. WHEN I provide agent identification THEN the system SHALL record the source agent information for tracking
3. IF a session with the same key already exists THEN the system SHALL return an error with existing session details
4. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL set it to active status with a configurable expiration time
5. WHEN session metadata is provided THEN the system SHALL store it for context enrichment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to add context information to an active session, so that the receiving agent has complete information for seamless continuation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call update_context with valid session key THEN the system SHALL add the context entry with proper sequencing
2. WHEN I specify context type (message, file, tool_call, system) THEN the system SHALL categorize and store the context appropriately
3. IF the session is not active THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the session status
4. WHEN context is added THEN the system SHALL update the session's last activity timestamp
5. WHEN large context is provided THEN the system SHALL handle it efficiently without performance degradation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to request a handoff to another agent, so that the target agent can continue the task with full context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call request_handoff with target agent THEN the system SHALL prepare a complete context package for transfer
2. WHEN I specify handoff type (context_transfer, full_handoff, collaboration) THEN the system SHALL handle the session lifecycle appropriately
3. WHEN the handoff is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a context summary for efficient consumption
4. IF the handoff is successful THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for the target agent to access the context
5. WHEN a full handoff is requested THEN the system SHALL mark the session as completed for the source agent

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to retrieve complete session context, so that I can understand the full conversation history and continue seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the session context resource THEN the system SHALL return all context entries in chronological order
2. WHEN I request context for a specific session THEN the system SHALL include session metadata and participant information
3. IF the session has been archived THEN the system SHALL still provide read-only access to the historical data
4. WHEN context is large THEN the system SHALL provide efficient pagination or streaming options
5. WHEN context includes different types THEN the system SHALL clearly categorize and structure the response

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to analyze codebase files for context, so that I can understand the technical context before or during a handoff.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call analyze_codebase with file paths THEN the system SHALL extract relevant code structure and dependencies
2. WHEN I specify analysis type (syntax, dependencies, structure, full) THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate level of detail
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL add the results to the session context automatically
4. IF files are not accessible THEN the system SHALL report specific errors for each file
5. WHEN multiple files are analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide a consolidated view of the codebase structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want reliable MCP protocol compliance, so that the server works seamlessly with any MCP-compatible client.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MCP client connects THEN the server SHALL properly advertise all available tools and resources
2. WHEN tools are called THEN the server SHALL validate input schemas and return properly formatted responses
3. IF invalid parameters are provided THEN the server SHALL return appropriate MCP error codes and messages
4. WHEN resources are accessed THEN the server SHALL provide data in the correct MIME types and formats
5. WHEN the server encounters errors THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the MCP connection

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to be production-ready, so that it can handle real-world usage with reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL initialize all dependencies and report readiness status
2. WHEN database connections fail THEN the server SHALL implement retry logic and graceful degradation
3. IF memory usage is high THEN the server SHALL implement efficient caching and cleanup strategies
4. WHEN concurrent requests occur THEN the server SHALL handle them without blocking or performance issues
5. WHEN the server shuts down THEN it SHALL perform graceful cleanup of all resources and connections

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want session lifecycle management, so that sessions are properly maintained and cleaned up automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessions are inactive for a configured period THEN the system SHALL mark them as dormant but keep them accessible
2. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL archive them while maintaining read access for historical purposes
3. IF a dormant session receives new activity THEN the system SHALL reactivate it automatically
4. WHEN cleanup runs THEN the system SHALL remove truly orphaned sessions while preserving important historical data
5. WHEN session status changes THEN the system SHALL log the lifecycle events for monitoring and debugging
